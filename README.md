Hello Friends of Termie,

As most of you know, Andy had a bit of a run in with the MUNI tracks on his bike a few weeks ago. He has a fractured elbow and a few face fractures.

He is having surgery today (Wednesday, March 6th, 2013 @ 2:30pm) and will be in the hospital most of the day.

I couldn't think of a better way to send a get well card to Andy than in the form of a public git repo. RIGHT.

Go forth, fork, and send a pull request. Add whatevs you think is awesome -- text, images, get well cards in the form of code. I'm sure he'll appreciate anything you put here. :)

He'll see all this when he's out of surgery in a few hours.

GO INTERNET!
