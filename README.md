Hello Friends of Termie,

As most of you know, Andy had a bit of a run in with the MUNI tracks on his bike a few weeks ago. He has a fractured elbow and a few face fractures.

He is having surgery tomorrow (Wednesday, March 6th) and will likely be in the hospital most of the day.

I couldn't think of a better way to send a get well card to a major open source contributor and nerd than in the form of a public git repository. RIGHT.

Go forth, add what ever you think is awesome -- text, images, get well cards in the form of code. I'm sure he'll appreciate anything you put here. :)

I'll just send him the link to the repo after his surgery tomorrow.
