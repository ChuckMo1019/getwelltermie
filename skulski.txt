Maybe Alone On My Bike
by William Stafford
-------

I listen, and the mountain lakes
  hear snowflakes come on those winter wings
  only the owls are awake to see,
their radar gaze and furred ears
alert. In that stillness a meaning shakes;

And I have thought (maybe alone
   on my bike, quaintly on a cold
   evening pedaling home), Think!--
the splendor of our life, its current unknown
as those mountains, the scene no one sees.

O citizens of our great amnesty:
  we might have died. We live. Marvels
  coast by, great veers and swoops of air
so bright the lamps waver in tears,
and I hear in the chain a chuckle I like to hear.
